Thus, a year ago we began to form an alternative to horrendous visual appearances and faceless work with clients. That’s why we founded Visiosto, the modern communications agency that can build experiences that touch heart and are visually appealing.</p>\n<p>During this past year, our producer Gurmann has focused on connecting Visiosto and its clients for our journey together. Our designer Anssi has materialized many graphical designs and danced with Photoshop. Our developer Antti has harmonized snippets of code into fully functional websites and steered our financials into the right direction.</p>\n<p>In the first year of our journey, our desk has seen various projects that we have refracted through our lens. Huge thanks to all of our clients for the past year! We’re eagerly looking forward to all of the challenges that lie ahead of us.</p>\n<p>However, Visiosto is more prepared than ever before! You’ll see us taking our activities to a whole new level. If you’re in need of website, graphic and visual design or events, the picture can be refracted through our lens!</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Anssi, Antti, and Guru</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Visiosto Celebrates Its First Birthday","author":"Gurmann Saini","datetime":"2020-07-01T21:08:22+03:00","date":"1 July 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"lang":"en","momentJsLocale":"en-gb","key":"/blog/visiosto-celebrates-its-first-birthday"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1685738288","1993971434","2346736672","2369593139","698804963"]}
